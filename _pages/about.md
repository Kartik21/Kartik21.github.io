👨🏻‍💻 Hi, I am Kartik! I am a graduate student in **[Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing (AMSC)](https://amsc.umd.edu/academics/program-concentrations/applied-mathematics.html)** at University of Maryland, College Park, advised by **[Dr.Marine Carpuat](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/)**.

🔬 My research interests are at the intersection of multilingual NLP and mechanistic interpretability. Through my research, I aim to uncover the inherent mechanisms within black-box LLMs that enable multilingual capabilities, probing how cross-lingual representations shape LLM-s ability to generalize across languages. 

👨‍💻 I am also a health economics researcher with over 8 years of experience in developing simulation models to assess the effectiveness of innovative treatments. I pursued the AMSC program at UMD while working full-time to strengthen my theoretical mathematical foundations, laying the groundwork for my current research in mechanistic interpretability. 

📽️ Previously, I have a MS in Industrial Engineering @Purdue University where I worked on network flow optimization. 

🎭 Aside from research and work, I enjoy running, cooking, and talking endlessly about the English Premier League.
